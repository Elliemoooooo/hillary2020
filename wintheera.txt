In the wake of seemingly never-ending crises, a mayor from the middle of nowhere, Indiana, rose to prominence and bested electoral titans of the likes of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. The Democratic Party rallied around him, swiftly overpowering Donald Trump's vile conspiracies in a landslide not seen since Obama in 2008, making him the first openly homosexual president.</p>\n\n\n\n</p>But now it's 2021, the nation was plagued by the pandemic and rising inflation, with no signs of ending without concrete action. He pledged to uphold democracy, but with the Republicans already champing at the bit to overthrow his administration, will The Boy Wonder guide the nation to an America they can believe in and <strong>Win The Era</strong>?</p>",
